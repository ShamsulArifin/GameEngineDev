# GameEngineDev

**GameEngineDev** is a foundational project aimed at developing a simple game engine using C and C++.  
The project utilizes the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library to manage graphics rendering, audio playback, and user input, providing a comprehensive framework for game development.

## Features

- **Graphics Rendering**: Leverages SDL to render 2D graphics efficiently.
- **Audio Playback**: Incorporates SDL's audio subsystem for sound effects and music.
- **Input Handling**: Captures and processes user input from various devices.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShamsulArifin/GameEngineDev.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
